Project Overview
===============

This project is a Single-Page Application (SPA) built with React, Redux, and react-router-dom. It provides a basic structure for a web application with routing, state management, and component-based architecture.

### Components

The application is structured into the following components:

* App: The main application component, sets up react-router-dom.
* Home: The Home section component.
* LiveReports: The Live Reports section component.
* About: The About section component.
* CoinsContainer: The Coins Container component, a placeholder for future content.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project root.
2. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Usage

1. The application has four main sections: Home, Live Reports, About, and Coins Container.
2. Each section can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding link in the navigation menu.
3. The application uses react-router-dom for client-side routing, so you can bookmark and share URLs.

### Redux

* store: The Redux store setup.
* reducers: The root reducer combining all application reducers.
* actions: The root action creators.

### Routing

* routes: The React Router setup, defining routes for the application.

### Importing Components

You can import individual components as needed:

```javascript
import { App } from './src/components/App';
import { Home } from './src/components/Home';
import { LiveReports } from './src/components/LiveReports';
import { About } from './src/components/About';
import { CoinsContainer } from './src/components/CoinsContainer';
```

Note: This project is a starting point for your own application, and you should customize it to fit your needs.
